# two months of Data scienceðŸ¤–ðŸ™Œ

For now (the next few months), It is my competition to enter the world of data science and go just small steps into  the field and then go deeper into every part of it.

Other than that, I will document my side projects as well as ML and DL topics that I learn about.
